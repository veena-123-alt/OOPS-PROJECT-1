Student Report Card Management System (C++ Project)
Overview

The Student Report Card Management System is a console-based project developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
It allows users to add student details such as name, roll number, and marks in three subjects.
The system automatically calculates the total marks, average, and assigns a grade based on the student’s performance.

Features

Add and manage student details easily.

Calculate total marks and average automatically.

Assign grades based on performance.

Display all student report cards neatly.

Demonstrates OOP concepts: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.

Technologies Used

Language: C++

Concepts: OOP (Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation)

Compiler / IDE: g++, Code::Blocks, Turbo C++, or Visual Studio Code

Platform: Windows / Linux / macOS (Console-based)

Learning Outcomes

This project helped me understand how to apply OOP principles to real-world scenarios.
I learned how inheritance and polymorphism make programs more reusable and organized,
and how encapsulation and abstraction help maintain data security and code simplicity.

Conclusion

The Student Report Card Management System is a simple yet effective project that demonstrates
how Object-Oriented Programming can make programs more structured, flexible, and realistic.
It’s a great starting point for beginners to practice core OOP concepts in C++.
